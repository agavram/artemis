(150-300 words)\n\nMany of the pieces feature a single piano without accompaniment:\n- Kinderszenen - Slower, peaceful, ternary form\n- Sonate Alla Turca - Piano Sonata. Rondo form\n- Minuet in A major - Slow dance piece played on piano\n- Well-Tempered Clavier - Written for harpsichord. Fugue\n- Arabesque - Impressionist\n- The Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach No. 4 - Minuet\nThe number of piano pieces is interesting considering that Eine Kleine Nachtmusik a string ensemble. Regardless, there is variety in the eras, and the form for each of the pieces. Surprisingly, none of Chopin's compositions are included despite him being one of the most well-known composers for the instrument. \n\nOtherwise there are pieces meant for whole orchestras\n- Spring Concerto - Solo violin highlight. Ritornello\n- Carmen: Habanera - Aria\n- Symphony No. 94 \"Surprise\" - Theme and variations\n- Hungarian Dance No. 5 - Fast paced, short dance piece\n- William Tell: Overture (Storm)\n- Swan Lake - Dance of the Swans - \n\nCello Suite No. 1 from Bach doesn't quite fit into the above categories. \n\nLastly, there is the String Quintet in E Major from Boccherini. This one is the most similar to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik because it is also performed by a string quartet, in this case quintet. Both pieces are quick and upbeat due to their major harmony. \n\nWe see familiar Classical composers in the list specifically Haydn,  Schubert, Rossini, and obviously Mozart. Vivaldi and Bach of the Baroque era make an appearance and of the Romantic era there is Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Schumann. We also find Debussy (Modernist). The pieces generally range from 17th century to 19th century. Which makes sense given that Eine Kleine Nachtmusik was from the Baroque era. There is also Boccherini (Classical) who we did not see in class. \n\nUnfortunately, none of the pieces recommended by Spotify were quite similar to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. No other serenades were included or string ensembles for that matter. \n\n### What is most appealing to you about this style of music? (150-300 words)\nThe reason I initially chose Eine Kleine Nachtmusik is because I personally enjoy listening to string ensembles. It is also a serenade with upbeat tempo making it pleasant and easy to listen to. \n\nFurther, it takes advantage of sonata-allegro form with its first movement. There is an ascending, fast-paced opening theme. It grabs the listener's attention and keeps them captivated. We eventually transition away to a gentle second theme which descends from the previous action. With development and recapitulation we hear the opening theme once more and end strongly. \n\nThe piece from Boccherini while also enjoyable, in my personal opinion doesn't have quite the same drama as Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. This is mainly due to the form of which the pieces are based upon. With a minuet we hear a very clear ternary (A-B-A) structure and a lively tempo meant for dancing. Sonata-allegro form simply leaves more room for the composer to explore the themes. \n\nBy contrast, many of the pieces included were also of slower tempo. One in particular that stood out to me was Debussy's Arabesque No. 1. I enjoyed hearing how the notes appeared to float about before returning to familiarity. To me, it doesn't feel like a harmony that was intricately designed by the composer, although thats what it is. Instead we hear the musician wandering through the notes on the piano and somewhat 'accidentally' discovering this mesmerizing main theme. \n\n\n### What was most challenging to you or expanded your usual listening habits? (250-400 words)\nLooking at my top genres on Spotify, I respectively see pop, rap, hip hop, pop rap, and alternative R&b making up the top 5. In other words, all of the songs that I normally listen to are of a completely different time period and genre. \n\nI think after listening to the Spotify radio for this assignment, my listening habits have greatly been expanded. I believe that I can appreciate works from other eras more whether it be Baroque, Romantic, Classical, now that I know more about the composers and the thought that went into crafting these pieces.\n\nFor example, with Vivaldi's Spring Concerto, which came up in the playlist, I know now about the programmatic aspect and how he takes advantage on of violin trills to imitate bird sounds. Additionally, it is fascinating to hear the expertise of the solo violinist playing with the force of a full orchestra behind them. \n\nWhen I'm listening to songs, its nice to pay closer attention and be able to identify the type of form it its. Obviously many times with pop music its easy to hear song form (A-A-B-A), but now its easier for me to recognize for example the theme and variations of Haydn's \"Surprise\". The class has made me pay closer attention to the inner-workings of pieces. I enjoy picking out different instruments and focusing on them or trying to figure out the form and texture. \n\nI think before, I felt as though many pieces of previous eras all sounded the same or dated. But now, I'm excited to hear something like Bach's Cello Suite No. 1. The rich timbre of the cello can be heard echoing through the performance hall and it carries many emotions along with it. Although it is absolute music and has no deeper meaning it is trivial for each listener to find their own beauty in it. \n\n### What makes your newly chosen piece from the playlist special? That is, what combinations of melody, harmony, texture, rhythm, instrumentation, expressive gesture, topic, and other features gives this piece its unique quality? (250-400 words)\n\nThe piece I have chosen is Hungarian Dance No. 5.\n\nI believe the aspects which makes it stand out from the rest of the pieces are its tempo, dynamics, and instrumentation. Brahms introduces the piece gradually with violins which start by playing legato before immediately transitioning into the true nature of the piece. Given its a dance, we hear an increase in volume of the strings followed by a flutter of notes from the woodwinds.\n\nThe listener is given little time to appreciate the gentle introduction before we hear the strings lead a charge followed by the flutes reaching what sounds to be their highest register. Brahms takes complete advantage of the range of many instruments through the piece. The contour can only be described as turbulent, with Brahms constantly toying with the listener's expectations. It is difficult to predict exactly what will come next. The orchestra assembles together as percussion joins in, further contributing to the chaotic nature of the piece. \n\nYet, Brahms quickly turns the piece on its head and suddenly we only hear soft, adagio violins as the piece had started off. The two sections of boisterous and calm are repeated throughout as we hear ascending, descending and forte/piano. The dance provides immense contrast with only brief breaks in between as the audience gets tugged back and forth. We hear two different themes in the piece, with the opening one seemingly continuously interrupting the second. \n\nThe instruments all rise and fall together in homophonic texture and deep, booming drums can be heard in the background setting a quick marching pace only to disappear seconds after they were introduced. Even the more peaceful portions of the piece appear to hint towards the dance. At one point, we hear a theme spaced divided by clarinets with sharp, yet gentle crescendos in the woodwinds and strings. \n\nNearing the end, we hear the opening theme once more in its controlled frenzy. The different instruments arguing, until they abruptly join together rising in somewhat of a 'rocket' theme. \n\n"},"Readings":{"hidden":false,"isDirectory":true,"sub":{"Week 1":{"hidden":false,"isDirectory":false,"sub":{},"content":"# Chapter 1 - Melody: Musical Line\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Melody - line or tune in the music\n  - Unique in contour and range\n  - Succession of different pitches\n- Contour - How it moves up and down (Think of a wavy graph)\n- Range - span of pitches or distance between highest and lowest notes\n- Interval - distance between two pitches\n- Conjunct - A melody that moves in small connected intervals\n- Disjunct - A melody that moves in leaps\n- Phrases - The units that make up a melody.

Quadruple has “broader feeling”, but very similar to duple\n\nSimple meters divide beat in two. **one**-and, two-and or **one**-and, two-and, three-and.\n\nNot all pieces begin with a downbeat. Sometimes can be upbeat\n\n# Chapter 3 - Harmony: Musical Depth\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Harmony - Describes the vertical component of music and how pitches (notes) sound together\n- Chord - Simultaneous sounding of three or more pitches. Chords are built from a scale or a sequence of pitches\n- Triad - Most common chord in Western music. Three alternate\n  pitches of a scale\n- Major / Minor scales - Most Western music is based on. Melody and harmony are derived\n- Tonic - The central pitch around which melodies and harmonies are built. The principle of organization is known as tonality\n- Dissonance - Created by unstable, or discordant, combination of pitches.\n- Consonance - Occurs with a resolution of dissonance, producing a stable or restful sound\n\n## Notes\n\nHarmony is central to Western music styles. Harmony defines the relationship between intervals and chords.\n\nChords and melodies are built from scales. do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do. Interval of eight notes is an **octave**\n\nThe first note of the scale is known as **tonic** and the organization around the aforementioned note is known as **tonality**\n\nMajor and minor scales dominate Western music from 1650 to 1900. The combination of intervals provides a distinct sound\n\n**Dissonance** is just a combination of notes that sounds unstable and requires resolution in the form of **consonance**\n\nA single sustained pitch is known as a **drone**\n\n# Chapter 4 - The Organization of Musical Sounds\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Octave - Interval spanning eight notes of the scale. Octave is divided into twelve half steps. Two half steps\n  make up a whole step\n- Chromatic Scale - Made up of all twelve half steps\n- Diatonic Scale - Consists of seven whole and half steps whose patterns form major and minor scales\n- Sharp (♯) Raises a pitch by a half step\n- Flat (♭) Lowers a pitch by a half step\n- Microtones - Intervals smaller than half steps (more common elsewhere around the world)\n- Tonic Chord - Built on the first scale note\n  - Home base (dominant and subdominant) to which active chords need to resolve\n- Composers can shift the pitch level (key) of an entire work (transposition), or change the key during a work (modulation)\n\n## Notes\n\n### Harmony: Musical Depth\nHarmony and melody are essential building blocks for compositions\n\nFirst note in octave repeats at the end\n\nHalf step is also known as semitone. 12 in an octave for Western music\n\n### Chromatic Scale\nThe twelve half steps are known as the chromatic scale\n\nBlack keys are named depending on the context of the current piece. Two half steps make a whole step\n\nWhite keys with no black keys in between are a half step apart\n\n### Major/Minor Scales\nMajor scale can be formed with W–W–H–W–W–W–H\n\nMinor scale can be formed with W–H–W–W–H–W–W\n\n### Diatonic vs. Chromatic\nDiatonic focuses on seven notes in either a major or minor scale\n\nChromatic introduces notes that are not in the scale by drawing from all twelve half steps in the octave\n\nMicrotones, which are not present in Western music, can make other music sound foreign and difficult to play on Western instruments\n\nAn inflection can be used to play microtones\n\n### Major Minor System\nTonic chord is built on the first scale step. Dominant is on the fifth scale step. Subdominant is on the fourth scale step\n\nModulation can be used to create tension in music by shifting away from the home key\n\nTransposing is taking an existing work to a new key\n\n# Chapter 5 - Musical Texture\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n(“Voice” refers to an individual part or line, even in instrumental music.)\n\n- Texture - The interweaving of melodic lines with harmony\n- Monophony - The simplest example of texture. A single voice or line without any accompaniment\n- Polyphony - Many voiced texture with different melodic lines\n  - Based on **counterpoint** which sets lines against each other\n- Homophony - When one voice is prominent over accompanying lines or other voices\n- Imitation - When a melodic idea is presented with one voice, then restated in another. Common unifying technique in **polyphony**.\n  - **Canons** and **rounds** are two examples of imitative works\n\n## Notes\n### Types of Texture\nIn **monophony** the melody is heard without any harmonic accompaniment or other melodic lines\n\n**Heterophony** has several musicians singing/playing the same musical line. However, some element is varied with each to create an out of sync effect. Could sound as if musicians are unable to stay together\n\n**Polyphony** has different melodic lines combined and set against each other\n\n**Homorhythm** is when many voices move together\n\n### Contrapuntal Devices\n**Canon** and more specifically, **round**, has voices entering in succession repeating that same melody\n\n# Chapter 6 - Musical Form\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Form - The organizing principle of music. Basic elements are repetition, contrast, and variation\n- Strophic Form - Repeated music for each stanza of text\n  - Through-composed form has no large repeated sections\n- Binary Form: (A-B) and Ternary Form (A-B-A) are basic structures\n- Theme - Melodic idea which can be broken down into smaller fragments\n  - Motive is a fragment. **Sequence** is when motive is repeated at a different pitch\n- Call-and-response (Responsorial Music) - Repetitive style which has a soloist and a group\n  - Music might be improvised\n- Ostinato - Repetition of a short pattern\n- Large-scale compositions are divided into **movements**\n\n## Notes\n### Structure and Design in Music\nRepetition satisfies need for familiar and contrast satisfies desire for change\n\nStrophic form offers repetition with each stanza but also some contrast within the stanzas\n\nDirect opposite fo strophic form is through-composed form where no main sections are repeated\n\nVariation alters some parts but keeps the original section recognizable\n\n### Binary and Ternary Form\nDifferent methods of dividing music\n\nBinary has a statement and a departure\n\nTernary extends the idea of the statement and departure by bringing back the first section\n\n### The Building Blocks of Form\nA theme is a building block in the construction of a larger work\n\nThe expansion of an existing theme is known as thematic development\n\nRestatement of an idea is known as a sequence. A small fragment that forms a melodic-harmonic rhythm is called a motive\n\n# Chapter 7 - Musical Expression: Tempo and Dynamics\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Tempo - The speed of the music\n- Allegro - Fast\n- Moderato - Moderate\n- Adagio - Quite slow\n- Accelerando - Speed up\n- Ritardando - Slowing down\n- Dynamics - How loud or soft music is played\n- Tempo and dynamics combine to form a means of expression\n\n## Notes\n\n### The Pace of Music\nGrave - Solemn (Very, very slow)\n\nLargo - Broad (Very slow)\n\nAndante - Walking pace\n\nVivace - Lively\n\nPresto - Very fast\n\n### Loudness and Softness\nDynamics denote volume\n\npianissimo (_pp_): very soft\n\npiano (_p_): soft\n\nmezzo piano (_mp_): moderately soft\n\nmezzo forte (_mf_): moderately loud\n\nforte (_f_): loud\n\nfortissimo (_ff_): very loud\n\nCrescendo to grow louder and decrescendo (diminuendo) to grow softer\n\n# Chapter 8 - Text and Music\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Vocalize - Using the voice as an instrument\n- Scat-singing - Made up syllables\n- Secular - Nonreligious music\n- Sacred - Normally sung in Latin\n- Syllabic - Each syllable of song text gets one note\n- Neumatic - Each syllable gets a few notes\n- Melismatic - Each syllable gets many notes\n- Vernacular - Language of the people\n\n## Notes\n### Text and Music\nNon-lexical is something that cannot be understood (scat)\n\nText can be used to organize tune. Poems are written in **stanzas** or **strophes**\n\n**Refrain** or **chorus** repeats after each stanza\n\n**Word-painting** uses words as an expressive device\n\n# Chapter 9 - Voices and Instrument Families\n## KeyPoints\n- Properties of sound include pitch, duration, volume, **timbre**, and **tone color**\n- Instrument - Generates vibrations and transmits them into the air\n- Soprano and alto - Female voice ranges\n- Tenor and bass - Male voice ranges\n- Aerophones - Flutes and horns\n- Chordophones - Violins and guitars\n- Idiophones - Bells and cymbals\n- Membranophones - Drums\n\n## Notes\n### Musical Timbre\nThe specific range of an instrument or voice is known as its register\n\n### The Voice as Instrument\nThe designations for vocal ranges, from highest to lowest, are **soprano**, **mezzo-soprano**, and **alto** (short for 'contralto\") for female voices; and **tenor**, **baritone**, and **bass** for male voices\n\n**Vibrato** attempts to mimic throbbing effect of the human voice\n\n### The World of Musical Instruments\n**Aerophones** produce sound using air\n**Chordophones** produce sound from vibrating strings\n**Idiophones** produce sound from the substance itself\n**Membranophones** are drum type instruments sounded from tightly stretched membranes\n\n# Chapter 10 - Western Musical Instruments\n## KeyPoints\n- Four Families - Strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion\n- Bowing, Plucking - Ways of sounding string instruments\n- Keyboard instruments do not fall into any of the categories\n\n## Notes\n### String Instruments\nViola is larger than a violin and has a lower range.

Ballet suites are quintessentially American in their portrayal of rural life\n- Believed that art should \"serve the American people\" during times of economic and social struggle\n- Copeland had evident nationalism, but was still investigated in the 1950s for potentially being a supporter of the Communist Party\n- *Appalachian Spring* is Copland's best known ballet\n\n# Chapter 61 - Classical Rethinking: Bartók and the Neo-Classical Turn\n## KeyPoints\n- Twentieth-century composers used more authentic folk and traditional elements in their nationalistic music than nineteenth-century composers did.\n- Hungarian composer Béla Bartók collected traditional songs and dances from his native land and incorporated elements from them into his compositions.\n- Bartók' s music displays new scales and rhythmic ideas and a modern, polytonal harmonic language, all set in Classical forms. In his programmatic *Concerto for Orchestra*, the whole ensemble is the \"soloist\"\n## Notes\n### Neo-Classicism\n- One way of rejecting the 19th-century was returning to even earlier eras\n- Composers began to emulate the great musicians of the early 18th-century. Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi\n- **Neo-Classical** turned away from the symphonic poem and the Romantic attempt to bring music closer to poetry and painting\n    - Preferred absolute music to program music and focused attention on craftsmanship and balance\n### Modernist Nationalism\n- Composers approached traditional music with a scientific spirit. **Ethnomusicologists** study music in its culture and global context\n- Romantic-era national schools continued into the 20th-century\n### Bartók and the Eastern European Tradition\n- Reconciled the traditional songs of Hungary with the main currents of European music\n- Bartók rejected the late Romantic orchestral sound in favor of a palette of colors all his own\n- His harmony can be bitingly dissonant with polytonality abound in his works. One of the great rhythmic innovators of modern times\n- Linear textures are brilliant examples of modern dissonant counterpoint. Still adhered to the logic and beauty of Classical form\n\n# Chapter 62 - New Sound Palettes: Mid-20th Century American Experimentalists\n## KeyPoints\n- Contemporary music often calls for innovative and highly virtuosic instrumental or vocal effects that challenge performers to new technical levels.\n- Composer John Cage used a specially modified **prepared piano** to simulate the sound of the **Javanese gamelan**, an ensemble of metallic percussion instruments played in Indonesia (on the islands of Java and Bali, in particular).\n- In his four books of madrigals, which treat the voice as a virtuosic instrument, composer George Crumb set texts by the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca.\n## Notes\n### Early Experiments\n- Several of Henry Cowell's innovations involved the piano. These include **tone clusters** (groups of adjacent notes played with the fist, palm, or forearm) and the plucking of the piano strings directly with the fingers\n- Scale of 43 **microtones** to the octave was developed by Harry Partch\n### The Music of John Cage\n- John Cage's most likely important contribution was the idea of **chance** or **aleatoric** music. His experimental compositions defined him as a leader in the post war avant-garde scene\n- *Sonatas and Interludes* represents Cage's crowning achievement for the **prepared piano**, approximating the subtle sounds of the Javanese gamelan\n- Cage had an immense interest in exploring the role of silence which led to a composition entitled 4'33\" as one of the most radical statements he had made against the traditions of Western music\n### George Crumb and Avant-Garde Virtuosity\n- Crumb has a talent for turning ordinary instruments, including the voice, into the extraordinary\n- *Caballito negro (Little Black Horse)* is the last of three songs in Crumb's second book of madrigals. The piccolo player uses a technique known as **flutter-tonguing**, quickly moving the tongue as though \"rolling an R\" while blowing into the instrument\n- Focused his music on creating new sonorities as well as exploring theatrical concepts\n\n# Chapter 64 - Less Is More: Reich and Minimalist Music\n## KeyPoints\n- Throughout the 1950s, the twelve-tone method gained prestige because of its perceived \"scientific\" nature.\n- Some composers who rejected twelve-tone methods but did not find older tonal approaches satisfying developed **process music** and a style eventually called **minimalism**.\n- Minimalist works rely on consonant musical elements repeated and gradually changed over extended time frames: an example is American composer Steve Reich's *Electric Counterpoint*, for multiple guitars.\n## Notes\n### From Twelve-Tone to Process and Phase\n- Some became dissatisfied with serial music's implicit lack of a harmonic center and decided to develop an approach that would treat stable harmonies in a new way\n    - Result is **process music**: a composer chooses a very simple and harmonically clear idea - one or two chords - and repeats it over and over again\n- **Phase music**: when a single recording is loop and played over itself at different phases\n- Influenced by Stravinsky's *Rite of Spring* and the music of Bach\n- One of the most influential musicians of the 20th and early 21st centuries"},"Week 2":{"hidden":false,"isDirectory":false,"sub":{},"content":"# Chapter 14 - Voice and Worship: Tradition and Individuality in Medieval Chant\n\n## KeyPoints\n- Sung worship is a shared feature among many world cultures, allowing for a more intense personal and collective connection with the divine\n- Religious communities fostered the extensive development of worship music\n- The music of the early Christian church, **plainchant** features monophonic, non-metric melodies set in one of the church **modes**\n- Chant melodies fall into three categories (**syllabic**, **neumatic**, **melismatic**), based on how many notes are set to each syllable\n- The expressive music of Hildegard of Bingen exemplifies the tension between an individual, creative response to divine inspiration\n\n## Notes\nHildegard was sent to the Church by her parents because she was the tenth child. 1/10th must be given up to the Church.

New material\n\nWhen all of the voices of the subject have been presented the **exposition** is over\n\nFrom then on the fugue will alternate between sections that feature entrances of the subject and **episodes**. Episodes are interludes which lack the subject and are meant as areas of relaxation\n\nSubject can be presented in augmentation (slower) or diminution (faster). Pitches can be stated backward known as **retrograde** or turned upside down in **inversion**. Overlapping statements of the subject are called **stretto** and serve to heighten the tension\n\n# Chapter 29 - Musical Conversations: Haydn and Classical Chamber Music\n\n## KeyPoints\n- Form is the most important organizing element in absolute music, which has no specific pictorial or literary program. Melodic ideas, or themes, are used as building blocks in a composition; these themes are made up of short melodic or rhythmic fragments known as motives.\n- Themes can be expanded by varying the melody, rhythm, or harmony through thematic development; this usually happens in large-scale works.\n- The Classical era is the golden age of chamber music (ensemble music for two to about ten performers, with one player per part). The string quartet (two violins, viola, and cello) was the most important chamber-music genre of the era.\n- The finale of Joseph Haydn's Joke Quartet features a playful tune that recurs as a refrain in a rondo form.\n\n## Notes\nRondo form is when the first section occurs multiple times\n\nA musical idea that is used as a building block in the construction of a composition is called a theme. \n\nVarying a theme's melodic outline is considered thematic development. (One of the most important techniques in composition)\n\nA theem can be divided into constituent motives. A **motive** is the smallest melodic or rhythmic unit\n\nA motive can grow into an expansive melody or it can be treated in sequence. That is, repeated at higher or lower level\n\nThe most prominent musicians of the Classical era were also excellent improvisers. Mozart and Beethoven drew crowds when they improvised on the keyboard\n\nForms of the Classical style are composed-out and fixed. Bach's fugue is a flexible process-in-motion\n\nIn absolute music, where there is no story, form is especially important\n\nA sequence of sections or movements is known as a multimovement cycle. Most instrumental works have this\n\nMany multimovements close with a **rondo** which is a lighthearted theme\n\n**Refrain** is repeated throughout. The main theme\n\nSimplest form for rondo is A-B-A-C-A. Example is Haydn's *Joke* Quartet\n\nOp. 33 is the only string quartet not in a set of six. He dedicated it to Grand Duke Paul of Russia, the son of Catherine the Great. Featured several new elements. Each quartet had a lively scherzo in place of the traditional minuet dance movement. Scherzo is a vigorous, light, or playful composition\n\n# Chapter 30 - The Ultimate Instrument: Haydn and the Symphony\n\n## KeyPoints\n- The symphony, a genre designed to demonstrate the expressive capabilities of a full orchestra, arose as one of the principal instrumental traditions during the Classical era.\n- The heart of the Classical orchestra (about thirty to forty players) was the strings, assisted by woodwinds, brass, and percussion. \n- Joseph Haydn wrote over 100 symphonies; among these, his last 12-the so-called *London* Symphones-are his masterpieces in the genre.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe interchange of themes between the various instrumental groups assumed the excitement of a witty conversation; in this, the **symphony** resembled the string quartet\n\nSymphony has its roots in the Italian opera **overture**. Overture had three sections, fast-slow-fast. First played to introduce an opera. The three sections eventaully became separate movements\n\nOne innovation was the use of a quick, aggressively rhythmic theme rising from low to high register with such speed that it became known as a \"rocket theme\". Drawn out *crescendos* were also used to gather force as they built to a climax\n\nDance movement was an elegant minuet\n\n### Second Movement: Theme and Variations\n\nThe second is usually the slow movement of the multimovement cycle. Offering a contrast to the first movement\n\nTypically it is an Andante or Adagio **A-B-A** or theme-and-variations form\n\nVariation is an important procedure in music, but in theme and variations it is the ruling principle\n\nTheme is clearly stated at the outset and serves as the point of departure\n\nAny musical element may be developed in the variation process. Melody may be varied by adding or omitting notes or shifting the theme to another key\n\nChords that accompany a melody may be replaced by others\n\nHaydn became known as \"father of the symphony\" after contributing over 100 symphonies to the genre and establishing the four-movement structure\n\nNo. 94 in G major is one of the twelve composed for London. Nicknamed *Surprise* because of a sudden *fortissimo* crashing chord in the slow movement, intended to startle a dozing audience\n\n# Chapter 31 - Expanding the Conversation: Mozart, Chamber Music, and Larger Forms\n\n## KeyPoints\n- The first movement of the Classical multimovement cycle is usually in a fast tempo and in sonata-allegro form, with three main sections: **exposition, development, and recapitulation**.\n- The third movement is a triple-meter pair of dances, usually a **minuet and trio**.\n- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a child prodigy who started to write music before the age of five, contributed to nearly all musical genres of the Classical era, including the symphony, sonata, concerto, chamber music, sacred music, and opera.\n- One of Mozart's best-known chamber works is Eine kleine Nachtmusik (A Little Night Music), a serenade for strings.\n\n## Notes\nSonata-allegro form became a favorite resource for instrumental composers, since the musical story it can tell is significantly more dynamic than the one available through simpler forms (for example, theme and variations)\n\n**Divertimento** and **serenade** were two popular chamber genre's in Mozart's day\n\nBoth are lighter genres that were performed in the evening or at social functions. *Eine kleine Nachtmusik* was a serenade for strings whose title means *A Little Night Music*\n\n### Sonata-Allegro Form\nThe most highly organized and often longest movement in multimovement cycles\n\nUsually in a fast tempo such as Allegro\n\nEstablishes a home key, then moves, or **modulates** to another key before ultimately returning to the home key\n\nSonata-allegro form may then be regarded as a drama between two contrasting key areas\n\nThe themes are stated in the first section, developed in the second, and restated in the third\n\n#### (1)\nThe **exposition** is the opening which presents the two opposing keys and their respective themes\n\nThe first theme establishes a home key, or tonic. A **bridge** or transitional passage leads to a second theme in a contrasting key. The function of the bridge is to modulate\n\nAfter the second theme, a closing section, sometimes has a new closing theme, which rounds off the exposition with a contrasting key. In eighteenth-century sonata-allegro form, the exposition is repeated\n\n#### (2)\n**Development** is characterized by conflict and action. This section may wander through foreign keys, building up tension against the inevitable return home. Frequent modulations contribute to a sense of activity and restlessness. When the development has run its course, the tension lets up and a bridge passage leads back to the key of the tonic\n\n#### (3)\n**Recapitulation**, or restatement, is the psychological climax of sonata-allegro form. The return of the first theme in the tonic satisfies the listener's need for unity. States the first and second themes more or less in their original form. However, now both themes are in tonic, thereby asserting the dominance of the home key. Movementn ends with a **coda** which is an extension of the closing idea that leads to the final cadence in the home key\n\n#### Summary\n\nFeatures of Sonata-Allegro form are present in many movements, yet not two pieces are exactly alike. What appears to be a fixed plan actually provides a supple framework for infinite variety in the hands of the composer\n\n### The Third Movement: Minuet-and-Trio Form\n\nIn the Classical instrumental cycle, the third movement is almost invariably a **minuet and trio**. The minuet was originally a Baroque court dance whose 3/4 meter embodies the ideal of an aristocratic age\n\nPresents two differences dances as a group, the first repeated after the second resulting in **A-B-A**\n\nThe dance in the middle was originally only meant for three instruments, hence \"trio\"\n\nAt the end of the trio, you find the words **da capo** signifying that the first section is to be played over again\n\nMozart was composing before the age of five. He rebelled against the social restrictions imposed by the patronage system and established himself as a struggling freelance musician at the age of 25. \n\n# Chapter 32 - Conversation with a Leader: The Classical Concerto\n\n## KeyPoints\n- The Classical concerto form has three movements, alternating fast-slow-fast.\n- The first movement, the longest and most complex, is called first-movement concerto form.\n- Mozart's Piano Concerto in G Major, K. 453-with its graceful melodies, brilliant piano passagework, and virtuosic cadenzas (improvised solo passages)-is a notable example of the genre.\n\n## Notes\nIf chamber music was designed to convey a musical conversation among equals, the Classical **concerto** was closer to a political rally. An inspiring leader helping to advance a larger group to a common purpose\n\nOne unique feature of the solo concerto is the **cadenza**, a virtuosic solo passage in the manner of improvisation that comes toward the end of a movement. The orchestra falls silent, and the soloiest launches into a free play of fantasy on one or more themes of the movement\n\n**First-movement concerto form** is sometimes described as sonata-allegro form with a double exposition. The movement opens with an orchestral exposition (or ritornello) in the tonic key, presenting several themes, followed by the soloist playing elaborated versions of these themes. The solo cadenza appears near the end of the movement, and a coda brings it to a close with a strong affirmation of the tonic key. \n\n# Chapter 33 - Personalizing the Conversation: Beethoven and the Classical Sonata\n\n## KeyPoints\n- Classical **sonatas** were written either for one solo instrument (usually the piano) or for duos (violin and piano, for example).\n- Sonatas were sometimes designed for amateur performance in the home, but were also used by composer-performers as showpieces. \n- The solo sonatas of Mozart and especially Ludwig van Beethoven are among the most significant in the keyboard literature.\n- The *Moonlight* Sonata, perhaps Beethoven's best-known piano work, evokes the new Romantic style in its expressive manipulation of Classical conventions.\n\n## Notes\nSonata was designed for a more intimate expressive space. Featuring one or two performers\n\n**Sonata** was understood by Haydn, Mozart, and their successors to mean an instrumental work for one or two instruments. Usually a piano, or a piano and a violin\n\nSonatas normally consisted of three or four contrasting movements. They followed the basic order of the multimovement cycle. \n\nFirst movement is long and dramatic. Sonata-allegro. Second is slow and lyrical. Andante or adagio theme and variations or **A-B-A**. The third movement is optional. Dancelike allegro or allegretto. Minuet and trio form. The fourth last movement is lively, spirited allegro or vivace. Sonata-allegro form again or rondo or sonata-rondo)\n\n# Chapter 34 - Disrupting the Conversation: Beethoven and the Symphony in Transition\n\n## KeyPoints\n- Beethoven's music is grounded in the Classical tradition but pushes its limits in a way that helped define the emerging Romantic sensibility.\n- Beethoven's nine symphonies exemplify his experiments with Classical conventions. Best known is his Fifth, built on a famous four-note motive that permeates all four movements.\n\n## Notes\n\nHad great influence on the orhcestral tradition and his influence can be felt to the present day\n\nHe had an ability to disrupt the elegant, balanced musical conversation of the Classical era. Yet he was still grounded in the tradition. His disruptions were strategic\n\nThe balance between convention and disruption is one major element that keeps Beethoven's music so compelling more than two centuries later. \n\nHis fifth symphony is considered to be a model of the genre\n\n# Chapter 35 - Making It Real: Mozart and Classical Opera\n\n## KeyPoints\n- In the Classical era, two types of Italian opera prevailed: **opera seria** (serious opera) and **opera buffa** (comic opera).\n- While serious opera continued a tradition of idealized characters and plots, comic opera aimed at a more realistic depiction of human concerns and emotions.\n- Mozart's Don Giovanni combines elements of serious and comic opera in a powerful dramatic work that is performed all over the world.\n\n## Notes\n\nOperas of the early eighteenth cnetury accurately reflected the society from which they sprang. The prevalent form was ***opera seria***: \"serious\" or tragic. \n\nAudiences and artists moved toward a simpler style that reflected human emotions more realistically: ***Opera buffa***. Initially seen as a less important counterpart to the serious tradition. \n\nComic opera was generally in the local language of the audience, although Italian *opera buffa* was popular throughout much of Europe\n\n# Mourning a Hero: Mozart and the Requiem\n\n## KeyPoints\n- Classical composers continued the tradition of writing worship music for their communities.\n- Sacred music genres of the later 1700s included the **oratorio, Mass, and Requiem Mass**.\n- Mozart's *Requiem*, left unfinished at the composer's death, exemplifies the grand style of Catholic music in Vienna.\n\n## Notes\nMozart had believed he was poisoned rather than diseased in his final days\n\nLetters show he was in a cheerful mood during his last fwe weeks and he was working on a number of projects alongside *Requiem*\n\nA **Mass** is a musical setting of the most solemn service of the Roman Catholic Church\n\nA **Requiem** is a musical setting of the Mass for the Dead\n\nThe **oratorio** is generally focused on a biblical story\n\nMozart could never have imagined how much his work would ultimately mean to the world\n\n*Requiem* was widely recognized by audiences from many cultures for its expressive power\n"},"Week 7":{"hidden":false,"isDirectory":false,"sub":{},"content":"# Chapter 37 - Musical Reading: Schubert, Schumann, and the Early Romantic Lied\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Typical Romantic song structures include strophic and through-composed forms; some songs fall between the two, into a modified strophic form.\n- The German **art song**, or **Lied**-for solo voice and piano-was a favored Romantic genre. Composers also wrote song cycles that unified a group of songs by poems or theme.\n- The poetry of the Lied projects themes of love and nature; favored poets were Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Heinrich Heine.\n- Franz Schubert wrote more than 600 Lieder and two masterful song cycles. Elfking (Erlkönig), a through-composed Lied based on a Danish legend related in a dramatic poem by Goethe, is one of his most famous songs.\n- Robert Schumann wrote over 200 Lieder, many inspired by his fiancée, pianist and composer Clara Wieck. These include A Poet's Love (Dichterliebe), a song cycle set to the poetry of Heine.\n\n## Notes\n\nMusic carries a subtle intensity not gained by simply speaking\n\nOften times Lied writers chose preexisting poetry\n\nGroups of Lieder that are unified by a narrative thread or descriptive theme are known as a **song cycle**\n\nPiano was the preferred household instrument of the ninteenth century\n\nSchubert composed more than six hundred Lieder in his life\n\n_Elfking_ was written by Schubert when he was still a teenager. Swift public recognition. Through-composed\n\nSchumann wrote _A Poet's Love_ which is a song cycle. Sixteen songs to poems originally written by Heinrich Heine. Syllabic\n\nInjured his hand and decided to become a composer instead of pianist\n\nSchumann's music is imbued with impassioned melodies, novel changes of harmonies and driving rhythms that reveal him as a true Romantic. Wrote four symphonies which exude lyric freshness and a Romantic approach to harmony\n\n# Chapter 38 - Marketing Music: Foster and Early \"Popular\" Song\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Nineteenth-century songwriters in the United States combined elements of European art song and opera with other traditions to create commercially successful \"popular\" music.\n- Songs often were popularized through minstrel shows, which were racially charged theatrical variety shows.\n- The minstrel and parlor songs of Stephen Foster (including Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair) were very successful during his lifetime and remain so today.\n\n## Notes\n\nParlor songs were songs accompanied by a piano and meant for home entertainment\n\nFoster helped build a powerful musical industry in 19th century US while earning very little profit. His songs were accessible\n\nEuropean immigrating to America brought cultivated repertoires of operas, chamber music, and symphonies. They also began traditions of lighter music. These traditions were thought of as vernacular. Performed by the same ensembles\n\nStephen Foster blended the vernacular American spirit and the European art tradition to make **parlor songs**. Several of his songs became popular through minstrel shows\n\n# Chapter 39 - Dancing at the Keyboard: Chopin and Romantic Piano Music\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Technical improvements to the nineteenth-century piano led to the development of the modern concert grand piano.\n- Polish composer Frédéric Chopin dedicated his entire compositional output to the piano; he is said to have originated the modern piano style.\n- Chopin's works include études (highly virtuosic study pieces), meditative nocturnes, preludes, and dances (including Polish mazurkas and polonaises), as well as sonatas and concertos for piano. His music calls for the use of rubato, or \"robbed time.\"\n\n## Notes\n\nThe piano is the most central instrument to Western musical tradition\n\nTHe instrumental was hailed as being equally suited to amateurs and professionals, to the home and to the concert hall\n\nLearning to play piano was a staple of refined education\n\nMelody and harmony could be performed on a single instrument\n\nAt first the performer was also the composer. Rise of the virtuoso pianist\n\nPiano manufacturing greatly improved and transitioned from craft shop to factory\n\nShort lyric piano piece or **character piece** was equivalent to the song. (Often had a descriptive title)\n\nChopin helped to refine short piano pieces. His music was rooted in Romanticism and made the era into a golden age for pianos\n\nChopin is credited with originating the modern piano style\n\nPolonaise is a Polish dance in triple meter. His music calls for the use of **rubato** or \"robbed time\" which allows for liberties to be taken without disrupting the basic beat. Left hand should remain steady while the right-hand melody is allowed to hesitate/hurry\n\n# Chapter 40 - Musical Diaries: Hensel and Programmatic Piano Music\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- While women in the nineteenth century were discouraged from composing by social convention, they played an essential role as patrons, sponsors, and teachers, as well as coordinating musical activity in the home.\n- Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, sister of Felix Mendelssohn and an important sponsor of his music, was also was a talented pianist and composer, known today for her Lieder and piano music, including the autobiographical cycle The Year (Das Jahr).\n\n## Notes\n\nWomen made great strides in establishing their careers as professional musicians and public advocates for musical innovation\n\nWith the rise of the piano women of the middle and upper classes now had a performance outlet that was socially acceptable\n\nComposition largely remain a \"man's province\", however some women broke away from tradition and overcame stereotypes to become successful composers\n\nHensel's cycle of piano works entitled _The Year_ shows the pinnacle of her artistry. 12 songs, one for each month, recording her year-long trip to Italy\n\nShe was actively discouraged from pursuing music as a career due to her gender\n\n# Chapter 41 - Personal Soundtracks: Berlioz and the Program Symphony\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Many Romantic composers cultivated program music-instrumental music with a literary or pictorial association supplied by the composer-over absolute music.\n- Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique is a five-movement program symphony unified by a recurring theme (idée fixe) that represents the composer's beloved.\n\n## Notes\n\nBerlioz composed a soundtrack to his own life. Combined his creativity with the idea of personal storytelling\n\nGenre that evokes images and ideas is known as **program music**\n\nProgram is supplied by the composer either in the title or in an explanatory note\n\nProgram music is the opposite of **absolute music** which is music for the sake of existing\n\nProgram music was important during the nineteenth century when musicians became more conscious of the connection between their art and the world around them\n\nSymphony was previously considered absolute. Berlioz however composed the _Symphonie fantastique_. Written when Berlioz was 27\n\n**_Idée fixe_** or fixed idea acts as a musical thread unifying the five movements of _Symphony fantastique_. Appereances are varied in harmony, rhythm, meter, tempo, dynamics, register, and instrumental color. This type of unification is known as **thematic transformation**\n\nHis scores required the largest orchestra ever used and made it clear he was a bold innovator of the nineteenth century\n\n# Section Notes\n\n## Classical\n\nMusic becomes very tidy with many rules\n\nCan be considered somewhat boring and not much depth to the music\n\n## Romanticism\n\nGets rid of the rules and focuses on feeling and telling stories\n\nThey are in the peak of the industrial revolution and believe that they are at the top summit of technology. They miss the old simple times. Pull back to nature and the sublime\n\nSupernatural is part of the beauty and terror. Sublime. Threat of existence\n"},"Week 8":{"hidden":false,"isDirectory":false,"sub":{},"content":"# Chapter 42 - Sounding Literature: Orchestral Program Music by Mendelssohn and Grieg\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Prominent types of Romantic program music include the **concert overture, incidental music** to a play, and the **symphonic poem** (a one-movement work).\n- Felix Mendelssohn drew on his passion for Shakespeare's plays in writing a **concert overture** that he felt encapsulated the story and expressive qualities of A _Midsummer Night's Dream_\n- Political unrest throughout Europe stimulated schools of nationalistic composers in Russia, Scandinavia, Spain, England, and Bohemia.\n- Edvard Grieg looked to the folklore of his native Norway in many of his works. His incidental music for Peer Gynt was written to accompany a play by Henrik Ibsen about this folk legend, then was excerpted into an independent suite.\n\n## Notes\n\n**Concert overture** is a single movement piece meant for an orchestra. Based on a literary piece\n\n**Incidental music** is music meant to accompany dramatic works\n\nOverture typically served as a single movement introduction to an opera. Some of the operatic overtures became popular as separate concert pieces which pointed to a new type of **overture** not associated with an opera. Must evoke a land- or seascape, or embody a patriotic or literary idea\n\nAnother type of program music, **dincidental music** usually consists of an overture and a series of pieces performed between the acts of a play\n\nFranz Liszt created the **symphonic poem** which is the nineteenth century's most original contribution to large orchestral forms. Program music for orchestra in one movement/ Contrasting sections that develop a poetic idea. Differs from concert overture by maintaining a freer structure. Also known as **tone poem**\n\n### Felix Mendelssohn\n\nTheir home was a meeting place for Berlin intellectuals. An orchestra performed under the direction of the seventeen-year-old Felix performed his Overture to _A Midsummer Night's Dream_\n\nHis sister Fanny as also a gifted pianist and composer with some of her works being published under her brother's name\n\nDedicated to preserving the tradition of Classical forms in an age that was turning away from them\n\n### Musical Nationalism\n\nPolitical conditions encouraged the growth of nationalism and it became a decisive force within the Romantic movement\n\nStruggle for freedom and conquering other nations gave rise to strong emotions that inspired the works of many creative artists\n\nSome composers based their music on songs and dances of their people, others wrote dramatic works based on folklore or peasant life. (Russian fairy-tale operas and ballets of Tchaikovsky)\n\nComposers gave expression to the hopes of millions of people\n\n### Edvard Grieg\n\nGrieg stood out for his ability to captyure the essence of his country's folklore and dance through music\n\nWorked to promote Scandinavian music through an academy he helped found. He felt more at home with smaller-scale works\n\nNorwegian government gave him a stiped and allowed him to focus on composition\n\n# Chapter 43 - Absolutely Classic: Brahms and the Nineteenth-Century Symphony\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Composers continued writing instrumental music without a program (absolute music) throughout the nineteenth century, including symphonies, concertos, and chamber music.\n- Romantic symphonies were characterized by lyrical themes, colorful harmonies, expanded proportions, and larger orchestras featuring new instruments.\n- German composer Johannes Brahms continued the Classical traditions of the Viennese masters in his four symphonies. His Third Symphony is Classical in structure but Romantic in tone.\n\n## Notes\n\nMusic is more flexible in communication than words. Sound can dig deeper into our emotions that the logic of words\n\nMany thought that program music which linked sound to a narrative was a step backward from the potential of music to express things beyond words. Described are proponents of **absolute music**\n\nRomantic composers continued writing in the multimovement genres that established the Classical era\n\nThe symphon gained importance in the wake of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Nineteenth-century composers found the symphony a suitable framework for their lyrical (\"singing\") themes, harmonic experiments, and individual expressions\n\nMusic had moved from the palace to the public concert hall and the orchestra had vastly increased in size\n\nThe fourth movement may at times also follow sonata-allegro form\n\n### Johannes Brahms\n\nDeveloped a lifelong affection for folk music, collecting songs and folk sayings throughout his life\n\nWrote the _German Requiem_ after the death of his mother\n\nAfter settling in Vienna, he began writing great symphonic works. Became enormously successful\n\nHis symphonies are unsurpassed in the late Romantic period for their breadth of conception and design. Brahms was a traditionalist and aimed to show that new and important things could still be said in the tradition of Classical masters\n\nLater generations of composers have often tried to find a middle way between fully absolute and explicity program music. Brahms helped revitalize Classical forms for the present day\n\n# Chapter 44 - Multimedia Hits: Verdi and Italian Romantic Opera\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Romantic opera developed distinct national styles in Italy, Germany, and France, and women singers excelled in all styles.\n- Both opera seria (serious opera) and opera buffa (comic opera) were favored in Italy; they marked the peak of the bel canto (beautiful singing) style.\n- Giuseppe Verdi is best known for his operas, which embody the spirit of Romantic drama and passion. His Rigoletto, based on a play by Victor Hugo, is one of the most performed operas today.\n\n## Notes\n\nBefore the age of recording, catchy excerpts in operas were marketed in arrangements, whether for the home, or for public places.\n\nThis allowed music to saturate its culture, becoming popular in both the economic and social sense\n\n### Women and Nineteenth-Century OPera\n\nBy the time of Mozart, castrati had been shifted away from and instead female sopranos sung\n\nWomen opera singers were among the most prominent performers of their day, in demand throughout Europe and the Americas.\n\nJenny Lind was an international star, famous for her roles in operas by the Italians\n\nWomen played an important role not only as singers and composers, but also as teammates to their musical partners\n\n### Verdi and Italian Opera\n\nItaly in the nineteenth century still recognized the opposing genres of **_opera seria_** and **_opera buffa_**\n\nOne of the most important composers of this era was Rossini whose operas marked the high point of **bel canto** (beautiful singing). Bel canto is characterized by florid melodic lines delivered by voices of great agility and purity of tone\n\nVerdi's music was adopted by those who supported political independence for Italy which was then under Austrian rule. The intensity of his compositions and the potential for some of the stories to be read as calls for liberation made him a figurehead for the Italian unification movement\n\nVerdi himself was only mildly political: he agreed to serve in the senate of newly unified Italy, but retired after only one term\n\n### Giuseppe Verdi\n\nVerdi returned to making operas with a libretto about Nebuchadnezzar. He created _Nabucco_ which launched his spectacular career\n\nVerdi identified himself with the national cause of liberating Italy from Austrian rule. His works took on special meaning for his compatriots\n\n# Chapter 45 - Total Art: Wagner and German Romantic Opera\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- In Germany, the genre Singspiel (light, comic drama with spoken dialogue) gave way to more serious works, including Richard Wagner's music dramas, which integrated music, poetry, drama, and spectacle.\n- Wagner's music dramas are not sectional (with arias, ensembles, and the like) but are continuous, unified by leitmotifs-recurring themes-that represent a person, place, or idea. His most famous work is the four-opera cycle The Ring of the Nibelung.\n\n## Notes\n\nRichard Wagner established the idea that multimedia can convery multiple meanings at once: words may be telling us one thing, and the music may be adding something else that is more sublte\n\n### Wagner and German Musical Theater\n\nNineteenth-century Germany had no long-established opera tradition, as Italy and France did. The immediate predecssor of German Romantic opera was the **_Singspiel_** which was a light or comic drama with spoken drama\n\nOne element that characterized German musical theater of the early 1800s was **melodrama**: scenes with spoken dialogue or minimal singing, but striking orchestral accompaniment to intensify the dramatic effect of the words\n\nWagner developed an \"endless emlody\" that was molded to the natural inflections of the German language, more melodius than the traditional recitative, but freer and more flexible that the aria\n\nHe conceived of opera as **total artwork** in which arts of music, poetry, drama and visual spectacle were fused together. Each element created and controller by the composer. **Music drama** is Wagner's term for operas\n\n**Leitmotifs** or \"leading motives\" recur throughout a work, undergoing variation and development like the themes and motives of a symphony.\n\n# Chapter 46 - Poetry in Motion: Tchaikovsky and the Ballet\n\n## KeyPoints\n\n- Ballet became an independent dramatic form in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly in France and Russia.\n- The ballets of Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky - _Swan Lake_, _Sleeping Beauty_, and _The Nutcracker_ - remain central to the repertory today.\n\n## Notes\n\nOut of movement, dance weaves an enchantment all its o wn. Dances synchronize their actions to the music\n\nThe choreographed dance known as **ballet** was central to lavish festivals and theatrical entertainments presented at the courts of kings and dukes\n\n**_Intermedio_** are spectacles with scenery, costumes, and staged dancing in Italy. **_Masque_** in England. **_Ballet do cour_** in France\n\nEighteenth century saw the rise of ballet as an independent art form. French-born Marius Petipa invented the structure of the classic **_pas de deux_** (dance for two) and brought the art of staging ballets to unprecedented heights\n\n### Tchaikovksy and _The Nutcracker_\n\nTchaikovksy composed well-loved works and was a giant of Russian ballet. Son of a government official who entered the newly founded Conservatory of St. Petersburg at 23.\n\nThere was social stigma associated with being a homosexual which may have led him to marry a student at the conservatory, but they soon separated\n\nTchaikovksy was the first Russian whose music appealed to Western tasts - it was performed in Vienna, Berlin, and Paris - and in 1891 he was invited to participate in the inaugural concert of Carnegie Hall in New York\n\nHe came under the spell of Italian opera, French ballet, and Germany symphony song, but was Russian \"through and through\"\n\n# Section Notes\n\n- Nationalism in music is a conscious use of musical material specific to the culture (folk songs, folk dances, etc.)\n- Nationalism in Music had a huge surge in the mid-late 19th Century\n\n- First internationally renowned Russian composer\n- He wasn't interested in exploring Russian identity through his music, rather, fitting into the Western European tradition\n- His music is operatic*\n- There is little conscious usage of folk idioms to emphasize a national identity.\n- Russian identity shows itself in the bold gestures and extreme level of dramatic expressivity\n\nMusic can sound triumphant but life overall can be very very difficult.

His orchestral work *Prelude* to *The Afternoon of a Faun* was inspired by a Symbolist poem, and later choreographed by the great Russian dancer Vaslav Nijinsky.\n- Debussy and his contemporaries were highly influenced by non-Western and traditional music styles heard at the Paris World Exhibition of 1889.\n## Notes\n### Symbolism and Impressionism in Paris\n- Impressionist painters tried to capture the freshness of their first impressions and the continuous change in the appearance of subjects through varied treatment of light and color\n    - **Impressionism** quickly became a term of derision, but Debussy tried to emulate the use of color and iridescence that characterize this new style\n- Symbolist movement sought to evoke poetic images through suggestion rather than description. (Fundamental quality of music)\n- Composer began to break from tradition to experiment with greater subtlety and expressive ambiguity\n    - New tone combinations such as the **ninth chord**. Hovered between tonalities evoking misty outlines of Impressionist painting\n- Debussy was the most important French composer of the late nineteenth-early twentieth century\n#### *The Afternoon of a Faun*\n- Debussy's best-known orchestral work\n- Statement-departure-return (**A-B-A'**)\n\n# Chapter 52 - Anything Goes: Schoenberg and Musical Expressionism\n## KeyPoints\n- Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg was highly influential in the movement called **Expressionism**. He believed in making music new through freeing dissonance from having to resolve to consonance, and eventually rejected tonality altogether (**atonality**).\n- Schoenberg's song cycle *Pierrot lunaire*, from his atonal-Expressionist period, incorporates **Sprechstimme** (speechlike melody) and **Klangfarbenmelodie** (tone-color melody).\n## Notes\n### The Emancipation of Dissonance\n- Throughout history listeners became increasingly tolerant of unfamiliar sounds. Twentieth-century composers emancipated dissonance by freeing it from the obligation to resolve to consonance\n### Schoenberg and Atonality\n- The impulse for Expressionist movement also came from painting\n- Favored hyper-expressive harmonies, wide leap in melody, and use of instruments in their extreme registers. Reached the boundary of what was possible within the major-minor system\n- ***Atonal*** music rejects the framework of key. Consonance was no longer relevant to Schoenberg's expressive needs. Pushed beyond the major-minor system. All twelve tones of the chromatic scale now had equal importance\n- With each new work, he moved closer to taking as bold a step as any composer ever has - the rejection of tonality\n### *Pierrot Lunaire*\n- Schoenberg chose texts for his song cycle from a collection of poems by Belgian writer Albert Giraud\n- His goals were to bring spoken word and music as close together as possible. ***Sprechstimme*** (speechlike melody) was a new style in which vocal melody is spoken rather than sung. Weird, but effective vocal line\n- ***Klangfarbenmelodie*** (tone-color melody) is where each note of a melody is played by a different instrument, creating a shifting effect evoking moonbeams mentioned in the text\n- Each poem is a **rondeau**, fifteenth-century verse form in which the opening lines of the poem return as a refrain in the middle and at the end\n\n# Chapter 53 - Calculated Shock: Stravinsky and Modernist Multimedia\n## KeyPoints\n- Modernist approaches to art, music, and dance were combined by the Ballets Russes in Paris, under the leadership of impresario Serge Diaghilev.\n- Russian composer Igor Stravinsky revitalized rhythm by increasing its complexity--using, for example, **polyrhythms** and **changing meters**.\n- Stravinsky's early works, including his ballets *The Firebird*, *Petrushka*, and *The Rite of Spring*, are strongly nationalistic; the last evokes rites of ancient Russia through new instrumental combinations and the percussive use of dissonance, as well as polyrhythmic and polytonal writing.\n## Notes\n### *The Rite of Spring*: Collaborative Multimedia\n- Ballet was revitalized with the career of the impresario Serge Diaghilev.\n- He invited artists, Picasso and Braque, to paint scenery and commissioned three ballets - *The Firebird*, *Petrushka*, and *The Rite of Spring*. Catapulted Stravinsky to fame\n    - Groundbreaking choreography by Nijinsky and music by Stravinsky\n- Stravinsky often uses the full force of the brass and percussion to create a barbaric, primeval sound and gives the strings percussive material\n- Orchestration is harsh and loud, with constantly changing colors\n- Stravinsky eventually immigrated to America in Los Angeles\n- Most innovative element of *The Rite of Spring* is the energetic interaction between rhythm and meter. Some scenes there is a study pulse, only to serve as a backdrop for unpredictable accents or melodic entrances\n\n# Chapter 54 - Still Sacred: Religious Music in the Twentieth Century\n## KeyPoints\n- Talented French artists and composers have long competed for a special prize, the Prix de Rome, that allows them the opportunity to live in Rome and explore their creativity.\n- Lili Boulanger, the first woman to win the prize, combined Impressionist ideas with the emerging modernist approach to dissonance. Her sister Nadia was a highly respected teacher as well as a composer.\n- Boulanger's *Psalm 24* is an example of modernist sacred music written from the perspective of personal devotion rather than commissioned by a religious institution.\n## Notes\n### Post-Impressionism, Lili Boulanger, and the Prix de Rome\n- New currents led to radical changes in music composition that assaulted the ears of listeners\n    - In France, composers could be found representing both camps. Boulanger embraced Impressionism and an innovative harmonic language\n    - First female winner of the Prix de Rome (Rome Prize). Instant fame for winners and launched careers\n### *Psalm 24*\n- One of three choral works Boulanger set to Psalm texts. *Psalm 24* is the briefest, but powerfully majestic\n- Contracted to write two operas and completed part of one, *La Princesse Maleine* on a libretto by the well-known writer Maurice Maeterlinck\n- Lyrical music with innovative harmonies and complex counterpoint\n\n# Chapter 55 - War is Hell: Berg and Expressionist Opera\n## KeyPoints\n- Arnold Schoenberg and his students Alban Berg and Anton Webern became known as a **Second Viennese School**, of modernist composition, in the first half of the 1900s.\n- Berg's music is rooted in the post-Romantic tradition, but he also drew on the twelve-tone system devised by his teacher.\n- Berg's most famous work is *Wozzeck*, an Expressionist opera based on a play about a disturbed man who moves between reality and hallucination in a society that has turned its back on him.\n## Notes\n### The second Viennese School and the Twelve-Tone Method\n- Schoenberg accepted the necessity of moving beyond the existing tonal system. Sought a unifying principle that would take its place. \n- Schoenberg's method is known as **serialism** (musical elements ordered in a fixed series). Based on an arrangement of the twelve tones known as a **tone row**\n- **Transposed row** keys the same order of intervals but begins on a different pitch. During **inversion**, the movements of the notes is in the opposite direction - up instead of down\n- **Retrograde** is the arrangement of pitches in the reverse order. **Retrograde inversion** turns the row upside down and backwards\n- Schoenberg's pioneering efforts revolutionized musical composition and were taken further by his students. Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Schoenberg were known as the **Second Viennese School**\n### Alan Berg and *Wozzeck*\n- Berg's style was rooted in German Romanticism - the world of Brahms and Wagner. Leaned towards formal patterns of the past: fugue, passacaglia, variations, sonata, and suite\n- *Wozzeck* was inspired by an early Romantic player by Georg Büchner that was based on gruesome, real-life events\n- With the premiere, he rose from obscurity to international fame\n\n## Section Notes\n- Lili and Nadia Boulanger\n    - Nadia is older of the two\n- Boulanger is a well-known composer in early 19th century France\n    - Won Grand Prix de Rome\n- Marries Russian princess\n    - 72 and 77 when he had children\n- Lili is sick and the mom had to take care of both of them\n    - French composer and organist\n    - First woman to win the *Prix de Rome*. Youngest win at 19\n    - Had perfect pitch\n    - Continuously flowing similar to Wagner. (Gesamtkunstwerk)\n        - Its the staging, costumes, music, orchestration\n    - Debussy's impressionism similarity: emphasis on harmony. More haunting harmony, not so specific. More abstract that doesn't necessarily resolve to the tonic. Not so much of a melody. Similar to impressionist painting. Sort of get the idea, get the concept without being directly told. \n    - Written when she was 19\n    - *Psalm 24*\n        - Similar to ride of the Valkyries\n        - Taking everything that is available to her and really stretches the music to its limit\n- Nadia\n    - Was not proud of herself and saw her sister as having better music\n    - Excelled at teaching and became an icon. Many of the most famous composers studied directly with her\n    - Completes and starts teaching at the Paris Conservatory\n        - All throughout Europe\n    - French composer, conductor, and noted pedagog\n    - First woman to conduct New York Philharmonic\n        - Boston Symphony Orchestra\n    - Nadia's music was far more simple. Still beautiful. Laidback, but less depth"}}}}}}}
