Regardless, there is variety in the eras, and the form for each of the pieces. Surprisingly, none of Chopin's compositions are included despite him being one of the most well-known composers for the instrument.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Otherwise there are pieces meant for whole orchestras</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spring Concerto - Solo violin highlight.

This one is the most similar to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik because it is also performed by a string quartet, in this case quintet. Both pieces are quick and upbeat due to their major harmony.</p>\n<p>We see familiar Classical composers in the list specifically Haydn,  Schubert, Rossini, and obviously Mozart. Vivaldi and Bach of the Baroque era make an appearance and of the Romantic era there is Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Schumann. We also find Debussy (Modernist). The pieces generally range from 17th century to 19th century. Which makes sense given that Eine Kleine Nachtmusik was from the Baroque era. There is also Boccherini (Classical) who we did not see in class.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, none of the pieces recommended by Spotify were quite similar to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. No other serenades were included or string ensembles for that matter.</p>\n<h3>What is most appealing to you about this style of music? (150-300 words)</h3>\n<p>The reason I initially chose Eine Kleine Nachtmusik is because I personally enjoy listening to string ensembles. It is also a serenade with upbeat tempo making it pleasant and easy to listen to.</p>\n<p>Further, it takes advantage of sonata-allegro form with its first movement. There is an ascending, fast-paced opening theme. It grabs the listener's attention and keeps them captivated. We eventually transition away to a gentle second theme which descends from the previous action. With development and recapitulation we hear the opening theme once more and end strongly.</p>\n<p>The piece from Boccherini while also enjoyable, in my personal opinion doesn't have quite the same drama as Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. This is mainly due to the form of which the pieces are based upon. With a minuet we hear a very clear ternary (A-B-A) structure and a lively tempo meant for dancing. Sonata-allegro form simply leaves more room for the composer to explore the themes.</p>\n<p>By contrast, many of the pieces included were also of slower tempo. One in particular that stood out to me was Debussy's Arabesque No. 1. I enjoyed hearing how the notes appeared to float about before returning to familiarity. To me, it doesn't feel like a harmony that was intricately designed by the composer, although thats what it is. Instead we hear the musician wandering through the notes on the piano and somewhat 'accidentally' discovering this mesmerizing main theme.</p>\n<h3>What was most challenging to you or expanded your usual listening habits? (250-400 words)</h3>\n<p>Looking at my top genres on Spotify, I respectively see pop, rap, hip hop, pop rap, and alternative R&amp;b making up the top 5. In other words, all of the songs that I normally listen to are of a completely different time period and genre.</p>\n<p>I think after listening to the Spotify radio for this assignment, my listening habits have greatly been expanded. I believe that I can appreciate works from other eras more whether it be Baroque, Romantic, Classical, now that I know more about the composers and the thought that went into crafting these pieces.</p>\n<p>For example, with Vivaldi's Spring Concerto, which came up in the playlist, I know now about the programmatic aspect and how he takes advantage on of violin trills to imitate bird sounds. Additionally, it is fascinating to hear the expertise of the solo violinist playing with the force of a full orchestra behind them.</p>\n<p>When I'm listening to songs, its nice to pay closer attention and be able to identify the type of form it its. Obviously many times with pop music its easy to hear song form (A-A-B-A), but now its easier for me to recognize for example the theme and variations of Haydn's &quot;Surprise&quot;. The class has made me pay closer attention to the inner-workings of pieces. I enjoy picking out different instruments and focusing on them or trying to figure out the form and texture.</p>\n<p>I think before, I felt as though many pieces of previous eras all sounded the same or dated. But now, I'm excited to hear something like Bach's Cello Suite No. 1. The rich timbre of the cello can be heard echoing through the performance hall and it carries many emotions along with it. Although it is absolute music and has no deeper meaning it is trivial for each listener to find their own beauty in it.</p>\n<h3>What makes your newly chosen piece from the playlist special? That is, what combinations of melody, harmony, texture, rhythm, instrumentation, expressive gesture, topic, and other features gives this piece its unique quality? (250-400 words)</h3>\n<p>The piece I have chosen is Hungarian Dance No. 5.</p>\n<p>I believe the aspects which makes it stand out from the rest of the pieces are its tempo, dynamics, and instrumentation. Brahms introduces the piece gradually with violins which start by playing legato before immediately transitioning into the true nature of the piece. Given its a dance, we hear an increase in volume of the strings followed by a flutter of notes from the woodwinds.</p>\n<p>The listener is given little time to appreciate the gentle introduction before we hear the strings lead a charge followed by the flutes reaching what sounds to be their highest register. Brahms takes complete advantage of the range of many instruments through the piece. The contour can only be described as turbulent, with Brahms constantly toying with the listener's expectations. It is difficult to predict exactly what will come next. The orchestra assembles together as percussion joins in, further contributing to the chaotic nature of the piece.</p>\n<p>Yet, Brahms quickly turns the piece on its head and suddenly we only hear soft, adagio violins as the piece had started off. The two sections of boisterous and calm are repeated throughout as we hear ascending, descending and forte/piano. The dance provides immense contrast with only brief breaks in between as the audience gets tugged back and forth. We hear two different themes in the piece, with the opening one seemingly continuously interrupting the second.</p>\n<p>The instruments all rise and fall together in homophonic texture and deep, booming drums can be heard in the background setting a quick marching pace only to disappear seconds after they were introduced. Even the more peaceful portions of the piece appear to hint towards the dance. At one point, we hear a theme spaced divided by clarinets with sharp, yet gentle crescendos in the woodwinds and strings.</p>\n<p>Nearing the end, we hear the opening theme once more in its controlled frenzy. The different instruments arguing, until they abruptly join together rising in somewhat of a 'rocket' theme.</p>\n"},"Readings":{"hidden":false,"isDirectory":true,"sub":{"Week 1":{"hidden":false,"isDirectory":false,"sub":{},"content":"<h1>Chapter 1 - Melody: Musical Line</h1>\n<h2>KeyPoints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Melody - line or tune in the music\n<ul>\n<li>Unique in contour and range</li>\n<li>Succession of different pitches</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Contour - How it moves up and down (Think of a wavy graph)</li>\n<li>Range - span of pitches or distance between highest and lowest notes</li>\n<li>Interval - distance between two pitches</li>\n<li>Conjunct - A melody that moves in small connected intervals</li>\n<li>Disjunct - A melody that moves in leaps</li>\n<li>Phrases - The units that make up a melody.

A <strong>bridge</strong> or transitional passage leads to a second theme in a contrasting key. The function of the bridge is to modulate</p>\n<p>After the second theme, a closing section, sometimes has a new closing theme, which rounds off the exposition with a contrasting key. In eighteenth-century sonata-allegro form, the exposition is repeated</p>\n<h4>(2)</h4>\n<p><strong>Development</strong> is characterized by conflict and action. This section may wander through foreign keys, building up tension against the inevitable return home. Frequent modulations contribute to a sense of activity and restlessness. When the development has run its course, the tension lets up and a bridge passage leads back to the key of the tonic</p>\n<h4>(3)</h4>\n<p><strong>Recapitulation</strong>, or restatement, is the psychological climax of sonata-allegro form. The return of the first theme in the tonic satisfies the listener's need for unity. States the first and second themes more or less in their original form. However, now both themes are in tonic, thereby asserting the dominance of the home key.

An inspiring leader helping to advance a larger group to a common purpose</p>\n<p>One unique feature of the solo concerto is the <strong>cadenza</strong>, a virtuosic solo passage in the manner of improvisation that comes toward the end of a movement. The orchestra falls silent, and the soloiest launches into a free play of fantasy on one or more themes of the movement</p>\n<p><strong>First-movement concerto form</strong> is sometimes described as sonata-allegro form with a double exposition. The movement opens with an orchestral exposition (or ritornello) in the tonic key, presenting several themes, followed by the soloist playing elaborated versions of these themes. The solo cadenza appears near the end of the movement, and a coda brings it to a close with a strong affirmation of the tonic key.</p>\n<h1>Chapter 33 - Personalizing the Conversation: Beethoven and the Classical Sonata</h1>\n<h2>KeyPoints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Classical <strong>sonatas</strong> were written either for one solo instrument (usually the piano) or for duos (violin and piano, for example).</li>\n<li>Sonatas were sometimes designed for amateur performance in the home, but were also used by composer-performers as showpieces.</li>\n<li>The solo sonatas of Mozart and especially Ludwig van Beethoven are among the most significant in the keyboard literature.</li>\n<li>The <em>Moonlight</em> Sonata, perhaps Beethoven's best-known piano work, evokes the new Romantic style in its expressive manipulation of Classical conventions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>Sonata was designed for a more intimate expressive space.
